        <p style="font-size:18px">SciMapper is a way to visualize a scientific concept's linguistic space.
            It takes a central search term, scrapes the abstracts of the most relevant articles and performs basic natural language processing to identify likely related concepts.
            It then performs the same function on each of these extracted terms to generate a network of connections between all concepts.

            Currently only <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PubMed_Central">PubMed Central</a> is being utilized, which focuses primarily on biological journal articles
            (however a diverse sampling of over 5 million articles are present).

    <h5 class="card-title">A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Hawkins J, Ahmad S, Cui Y</h6>
    <p class="card-text">The neocortex is complex. Within its 2.5 mm thickness are dozens of cell types, numerous layers, and intricate connectivity patterns. The connections between cells suggest a columnar flow of information across layers as well as a laminar flow within some layers. Fortunately, this complex circuitry is remarkably preserved in all regions, suggesting that a canonical circuit consisting of columns and layers underlies everything the neocortex does. Understanding the function of the canonical circuit is a key goal of neuroscience</p>
